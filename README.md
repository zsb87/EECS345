## Project 0: NU Chitter
### SUMMARY
This is the first project for the course, which we have called "NU Chitter". It should serve as both an introduction to Go as well as a self-evaluation of proficiency in networking and systems programming. This project must be completed individually. All submissions should be 100% your own work and will be graded on a Pass/Fail scale -- either the submitted code works or it does not.
