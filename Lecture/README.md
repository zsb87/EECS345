## TOPICS

* Introduction
* Networking and Internetworking
* Remote invocation and indirect communication
* Overlay networks and P2P
* Distributed file systems
* Name services
* Time and global state

* Mobile distributed systems

For each of the topics, we will first review introductory material before presenting and discussing a related research paper to help you better understand the main issues.

The following is our intended calendar with topics, slides (as they become available) and reference material. Note "CDKB5 #" refers to chapters of the class' textbook (Coulouris et al., Distributed Systems: Concepts and Design, 2012). Also, papers tagged as [Q] may be part of homework assignment/finals questions for extra credit.
